If you already have Truffle installed, you can use it to compile the `ImageStorage.sol` smart contract and obtain the contract's ABI and bytecode. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your Truffle project.

2. Place the `ImageStorage.sol` file inside the `contracts/` directory of your Truffle project.

3. In the terminal, run the following command to compile the contracts:
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```

   Truffle will automatically compile all the Solidity contracts inside the `contracts/` directory.

4. After the compilation is complete, Truffle will create a `build/` directory in your project's root directory.

5. Inside the `build/contracts/` directory, you will find a JSON file named `ImageStorage.json`. This file contains the compiled contract's ABI, bytecode, and other related information.

6. Open the `ImageStorage.json` file, and locate the `abi` and `bytecode` fields.

   - Copy the contents of the `abi` field and replace `<YOUR_CONTRACT_ABI>` in the Express server code with it.

   - Copy the contents of the `bytecode` field and replace `<YOUR_CONTRACT_BYTECODE>` in the Express server code with it.

Once you have replaced `<YOUR_CONTRACT_ABI>` and `<YOUR_CONTRACT_BYTECODE>` with the respective values from the `ImageStorage.json` file, you can use the Express server code to interact with the deployed `ImageStorage` contract on the BSC network.

Remember to ensure that the Truffle project is configured to connect to the correct BSC network and that you have deployed the `ImageStorage` contract to that network before running the Express server.
